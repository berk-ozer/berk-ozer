Hi, I'm Berk! 👋

I'm a software engineer with 5+ years of professional experience building Clojure applications. 

- 👨🏻‍💻 I currently work at Bloom Ventures, building startups and software in Clojure like [Unstuck](https://www.unstuckapp.com/).
- 👨🏻‍🏫 I used to work as a web development mentor for [Freemote](https://freemote.com) where I mentored 500+ developers while creating 2,000+ personalized code review videos.
- 🪐 I built the Android version of [Cosmic Walk](https://www.cosmicwalk.app/) in Flutter, an app that takes hard-to-imagine times and distances and maps them onto long walks.

Outside of software I enjoy 🏂 snowboarding, 🏕️ hiking & backpacking and 🧘🏻‍♂️ meditating.
