Hi, I'm Berk! 👋

I’m a Full-Stack Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience building web and mobile applications end-to-end, from APIs and databases to polished UIs.

- 👨🏻‍💻 I currently work at Bloom Ventures, building web applications in industries like legal tech ([Be Right There](https://berightthere.com)) and remote team productivity ([Unstuck](https://www.unstuckapp.com/))
- 👨🏻‍🏫 At [Freemote](https://freemote.com), I mentored 500+ developers and created 2,000+ instructional videos, simplifying complex technical topics and helping learners grow.
- 🪐 I built the Android version of [Cosmic Walk](https://www.cosmicwalk.app/) in Flutter, an app that takes hard-to-imagine times and distances and maps them onto long walks.

Outside of software I enjoy 🏂 snowboarding, 🏕️ hiking & backpacking and 🧘🏻‍♂️ meditating.
